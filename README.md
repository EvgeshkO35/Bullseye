# Bullseye
iOS &amp; SwiftUI App from Scratch

## My Goal

My goal is create game application using SwiftUI framework and also learn the basics of SwiftUI. I’ll also dive into the Swift programming language itself, learning fundamentals like if/else statments, variables, constants, type inference, and the Swift standard library. I’ll even learn useful techniques you’ll use as a developer in the real world, like App Architecture and Unit Testing!

I’ll learn how to extract your SwiftUI views in order to keep your code clean, reusable, and maintainable, and I’ll continue to use test-driven development to build out and expand your app’s data model. I’ll also learn about tons of handy techniques that I’ll be using all the time as a professional iOS Developer, including how to use SFSymbols, SwiftUI Animation, Size Classes, and so much more.


## What I created

By the end of this project, not only will I have created app using SwiftUI framework, but I’ll have created a polished app that can carry around in your pocket, an show of to my family and friends.
